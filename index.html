                    From our research bootcamps tend to offer the option to split your tuition over 3 or
                    4 payments which can be around £2500 each, or they offer finance agreements that come with
                    varying levels of interest.
                </p>

                <p>If you are a UK citizen, and you choose to go to university, you may be able to get
                    student finance.
                    The interest rate for this is currently 7.3%.</p>

                <p>At Flatpack you'll get a full hour of 1-2-1 time every week with your tech lead. You
                    can
                    have 2x 30
                    minute sessions instead if this works better for you.</p>

                <p>Bootcamps and universities usually schedule in some time over the course for you to
                    spend
                    1-on-1 with
                    your tutor, but this isn't guaranteed. Often tutors open their time up to 'office
                    hours'
                    as and when
                    they might have some spare time. At Flatpack our tech leads can schedule 1-2-1s 6
                    days a
                    week from
                    8am
                    until 10pm (UK Time).</p>

                    Every week you'll get invited to 1 or 2 group sessions that are specifically for the module that
                    you're currently working on where you can ask questions and network with other people on your
                    course.
                </p>
                <p> For transparency, bootcamps and universities do also allow this as classes usually happen in a group
                    setting.

                <p>Our fully on-demand instruction allows you to fit the course around your schedule and
                    commitments.
                    Bootcamps and universities will require you to be in lessons at a time scheduled by
                    them.</p>

                <p>Additionally if you need to pause for a week or so to go on holiday or to make a big
                    deadline at
                    work,
                    that's totally fine.</p>

            <div class="tooltip" id="tip-6">
                <p>As all of the lessons are recorded you can rewatch them as and when you like. If you need a refresher
                    then you can go back and watch it again.</p>

                <p>Be aware that many remote bootcamps also record their lessons, the lesson content is designed to be
                    delivered live so watching them back can be of limited value.</p>


            </div>
            <div class="tooltip" id="tip-7">
                <p>Ultimately we keep a really close eye on changes in technology and employer demands. If a certain
                    technology updates, our course updates. If employers require different skills, we change the
                    material to
                    match. We are constantly updating our course to match the industry.</p>

                <p>Generally speaking universities are stuck teaching technology that is outdated or more suited to
                    academia rather than real world employment.</p>

            <div class="tooltip" id="tip-8">

                    isn't for everyone, just let us know you don't want to continue and we will refund you everything
                    you've
                    paid, with no fuss.</p>

                <p>Coding bootcamp have their own policies that mean you may or may not be eligible for refunds. If you
                    decide to attend a coding bootcamp make sure you understand their policies, as some are less
                    forthcoming
                    with this information than others.</p>

            <div class="tooltip" id="tip-9">
                <p>The hours of tuition that you'll actually get varies by course, be aware that a lot of bootcamps
                    include
                    the time you're doing self directed study into this time.</p>

                <p>
                    At flatpack you get 280 hours of on-demand tuition,
                    plus an aditional 52 hours of 1 to 1 support with your tech lead and a minimum of 52 hours of group
                    mentoring sessions. Don't forget you'll also get tutoring from outside speakers too.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="tooltip" id="tip-10">
                <p>This is the one thing that bootcamps give that other courses dont. As you'll be attending weekly
                    group,
                    and 1 on 1 sessions with your tech lead you'll be kept accountable. We work around you and ensure
                    that
                    you have the support and tuition that you need to become a successful software engineer.</p>

                <p>Also you'll receive daily email reminders to make sure you're staying on track.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tooltip" id="tip-11">
                <p>Whilst many self paced Udemy style courses will say that you get instructor support, it normally
                    means
                    that you have access to a discord or slack channel where you can ask questions. Be aware that
                    support
                    can be sporadic.</p>
                <p>At Flatpack we only take on the number of students that we can properly support, and
                    your tech leads are active on Slack from 8am to 10pm 6 days a week. (though it's likely we are
                    around
                    7 days a week).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tooltip" id="tip-12">
                <p>Just like outside of class, whilst you're in lessons, you can reach out to your instructors and
                    fellow
                    students
                    to ask questions if you don't understand something, or something is not working.</p>

            <div class="tooltip" id="tip-13">
                <p>All Flatpack students get world class career support both in our career support module, as well as 1
                    to
                    1 sessions covering interview coaching, CV surgeries, Portfolio reviews, and more.</p>

                <p>The career support at different bootcamp providers can have mixed results. If you decide to go down
                    another route, ensure that the provider will give you the 1-to-1 support that you are expecting to
                    receive.</p>

                <p>At university you'll likely get a couple of sessions with a careers counselor. This can vary by
                    university so again make sure you get what you're paying for.</p>


            </div>
            <div class="tooltip" id="tip-14">
                <p> At many bootcamp providers we have noticed that they offer group sessions that are designed to give
                    you
                    an idea of what an interview process will look like.</p>

                <p>At flatpack you will get 1 on 1 and group coaching that will ensure you're fully prepared for your
                    interviews.
                    Whether you require a mock interview or some coaching based on the job description of the role
                    you're
                    interviewing for, we will provide whatever works best for you.</p>

            <div class="tooltip" id="tip-15">
                <p>We will provide you with a professional certificate of achievement to

            </div>
            <div class="tooltip" id="tip-16">
                <p>We are constantly talking to hiring companies as they are looking for talent just like you. Unlike
                    universities and self paced courses we get to know you and your skills really well, so if we see a
                    good
                    match between you and a hiring company we will put you in touch and manage the introductions for
                    you.
                </p>
                <p>Bootcamps often also have hiring partners too, but you should ask the provider whether the company is
                    currently actively hiring for their talent, or whether they are a past client.</p>

                <p>At flatpack we take everyone on a case by case basis, whilst our ultimate aim is to get you into a
                    job
                    that you love we won't promise you anything that we can't provide.</p>

            <div class="tooltip" id="tip-17">
                <p>We have a rolling schedule of events from industry professionals on a variety of topics from
                    employment
                    and getting the job, all the way to advanced technical topics such as AI implementation and software
                    architecture. Look out for these events throughout the course.</p>

                <p>Universities and bootcamps may also provide some external speakers too but in our experience, these
                    can
                    be quite sporadic.</p>

            <div class="tooltip" id="tip-18">
                <p>By the very nature of self learn courses their projects have to be quite 'cookie cutter' as the
                    amount
                    of support you have available to you is minimal. Many of the projects that they provide follow a
                    'codealong' format.</p>

                <p>At flatpack we give you real-world style project briefs that are unique and allow you to show your
                    own
                    unique flair. As you'll get instructor and tech lead support throughout your projects, you have the
                    freedom and flexibility to create projects as unique as you are. To be fair this will also be the
                    case
                    with bootcamp providers, but do make sure that the projects on the course aren't too simplistic,
                    hiring
                    managers are fed up of seeing the thousandth tic-tac-toe game or yet another youtube clone.</p>

            <div class="tooltip" id="tip-21">
                <p>Any bootcamp that says they will guarantee you a job is highly likely an outright scam. Job
                    guarantees
                    generally take two forms, either the provider simply has the financial backing to refund you after
                    they've wasted a year or more of your time, or more nefariously the bootcamp will hire you back on a
                    low
                    paid 'teaching assistant' role. Alternatively you may be offered a job at a hiring partner. Make
                    sure
                    that you know what sort of salary these jobs have and what the working expectations are before
                    relying
                    on the 'job offer guarantees'.</p>

                <p>Additionally, some providers also give you the option to take out finance that you pay back once you
                    have a job. The amount you pay back can be eye watering and whilst it can seem like a good idea to
                    begin
                    with, in case you fail to get a job, the effective interest rates can be huge once you are working.
                </p>

                <p>We don't plan to offer this kind of agreement at all as we are yet to find a policy that actually
                    works
                    well for students. We would much rather keep our prices affordable instead.</p>
